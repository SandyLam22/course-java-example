Java Examples
======================================================

This project contains the Java examples that I have been using to teach my students in the past few years. The course is an introduction to OO programming and many of the code samples are from the textbook [Introduction to Java Programming](http://www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/intro9e/) by Y. Daniel Liang. From time to time I have been adding more examples to this project and now I just share it here so that more people can enjoy the fun of programming!

As part of the learning, you are welcome to submit issues or folk this repos to make it better.

## Requirement

* [JDK 6 or above](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Netbeans IDE](https://netbeans.org/) (optional but preferred)

## Installation

Create a blank Java project in Netbeans and drop this **src/** folder to the root of your project. 

Alternatively, you can use git to clone this project. In this way, I think you are skillful enough to build it in command-line. ;)
